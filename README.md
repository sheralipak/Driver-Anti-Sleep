# Driver-Anti-Sleep
Driver Anti Sleep using Assembly Language and Proteus
This project implements a simulated driver drowsiness detection and alert system using Assembly Language and the Proteus Design Suite.  Key features include:

Microcontroller Programming: Assembly code for a microcontroller (specify the type you'll use) to process sensor data and trigger alerts.
Proteus Simulation: A complete Proteus circuit design, including sensors (e.g., eye-blink sensor, head position sensor), microcontroller, and alert mechanism (e.g., buzzer, LED).
Detection Logic: Assembly routines to analyze sensor input and determine driver drowsiness levels.
Focus on Learning: Well-commented code and Proteus setup emphasize educational value for Assembly and embedded systems concepts.
